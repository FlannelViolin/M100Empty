This is the M100Empty project for ATT hackathons. 

--------

To develop with android you need to install adt:
 http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

-------

Next to develop for the m100 specifically you need to add a vendor id to:

.android/adb_usb.ini (if you have adt installed this should be in your home directory)
If this file does not exist please create it.

add: 0x1BAE 
to the file on its own line followed by a single line of white space. 

If you have started adb type in the cmd line: adb kill-server

If adb does not work at this point, delete the white space and try again.
