This is the M100Empty project for AT&T hackathons. 

--------

To develop with android you need to install adt:

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html

-------

Next, to develop for the M100 specifically, you need to add a vendor ID to:

.android/adb_usb.ini (if you have ADT installed the .android folder should be
hidden in your home directory)

If this file does not exist please create it.

Add the following line to the file:

0x1BAE 

There should be no empty lines before 0x1BAE, and exactly one empty line 
following it.

If you have started ADB, type in the command line/terminal: adb kill-server

If ADB does not work at this point, delete the white space and try again.

-------

On downloading the repo, if you are getting errors in your values/style.xml

    Right click on the project, select Properties
    Select Android
    In the Library section at the bottom, click Add....
    Select android-support-v7-appcompat in the dialog.
    Click Apply.
    Click OK.
